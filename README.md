# Biddaroo - Semester Project Fall 2024

![image]()

For my semester project, I made an auctionpage for a fake auctionsite called Biddaroo. This auction site allows users to register, login and make your own auctions. 

## Description
Biddaroo is an auction page for users to post fake auctions. When you create a new profile on the page you automatically get 1000 credits to use to bid on auctions. 
You can make an auction about anything you like and add up to eight pictures per auction. If the auction contains more than one image there will be possible to scroll
through the pictures with a carousel. Here you also have the option to bid on the auction or see what others have bid already. 

### Design Phase:
Figma Design: I began by creating the design in Figma. I started playing around a bit, but wanted to have a dark, elegant theme. I ended up with a very simple design with
only a couple of colors and a clean startpage with the login and register function on the mainpage. 

### Development Phase:
HTML, CSS and Javascript: The next phase of the project was coding it. I put off three weeks for the javascript part as it would be the more timeconsuming part. When I
felt like I was done with this I started the CSS phase where I used Tailwind as a framework. This part I put off one week for. 

### Features:
Homepage: The homepage provides a list of all the auctions with shortest time left of their auctiontime. This makes it easier to bid on auctions before its too late. 
The homepage also offers a searchbar where you can search through all the auctions on the page to find what you are looking for. 

#### Logged in
Edit and create posts: If you are logged in you get a seperate page for editing and creating new auctions. Here you can also delete posts if the listing is yours. 
You also can look at your profile and check how many credits you have left on your account, as well as editing your profile. You can edit your username, banner and 
avatar here. 

### Target Audience:
If the website was real it would be designed to be appealing to people who have something valueble they would like to sell on an auction. Now it's just for anyone
who wants to try and make an auction or bid on others for the fun of it. 

## Built with
- HTML
- CSS - Tailwind
- Javascript

## How to setup
You can search through posts and look at posts as an unregistred user, but if you want to join in on the fun you can also make your own user and bid on and make your own
auctions. The way to do this is simple. You just have to use an email with the "@stud.noroff.no" format. It doesn't have to be a real email, you just have to use this format
for the registration to work. After this you can log in.
